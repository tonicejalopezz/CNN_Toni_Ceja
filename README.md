# Convolutional Neural Network

This convolutional neural network uses data from FashionMNIST to predict images.

The design uses convolution layers, max pooling, and RELU activation functions.

This is processed in mini-batches using cross-entropy as the loss function, Adam as the optimizer, and a schedular on the learning rate.


After 15 epochs, the model was overfitting with about 95% accuracy on the training dataset and about 90% on the testing dataset.
